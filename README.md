# Clock_webapp

### You can see webapp at [Clock App](https://harshgami.github.io/Clock_webapp/).

In this webapp, I used basics of HTML, CSS and Javacript.
This webapp is responsive. 

You can see time by **Analog** as well as by digital clock.

You can also see time of different **Time Zone**.

You can also set **Alarm** (Set alarm according 24 hours.)

You can also use **Stopwatch**.

You can also use **Timer** functionalily to set timer for any work duration.
